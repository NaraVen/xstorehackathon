# Hackathon for XStore

## BlobFuse with WSL

This is a no-code challenge. With WSL 2.0 Windows has added first class support for Linux. This challenge is to try it out and file bugs in the github repo and/or submit wikis for better setup for our customers (Example: syslog is not available in WSL by default et al). Don't restrict yourself to Ubuntu, try as many flavors as you can.
