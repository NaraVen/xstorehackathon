# Hackathon for XStore

## Control the throttling behavior in your application
Azure Storage throttling behavior can be better understood by our customers if we can write a sample for them that shows them easy ways to get throttled and then how to backoff just at the write time so that they do not get throttled.

This project can be a single project across various services or a single project per service or just a subset. You choose!
