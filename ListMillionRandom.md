## List Millions of objects in a Random non-Lexicographic order

Listing is one of the challenging things our customers face everyday. The ability to list in a non-lexicographic order may help some customers with breaking their job up better et al. Can you write an algorithm that can list all the items in the container in a non-lexicographic order.This can be a simple multi-threaded list or something smarter that can avoid throttling. You also should think about the number of REST calls as it has a billing impact. (A customer once complained that every time he lists it cost $120)
