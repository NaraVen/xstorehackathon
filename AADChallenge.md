# Hackathon for XStore

## AAD integration with storage

This is not exactly storage related, but for folks who are AAD experts. Misconfigured AAD gives us quite a few customer satisfaction headaches.

Can we build a sample+Script that shows the steps to configure AAD and set it up with a storage account? The end product must include a few storage operations like upload/download/list. The more nuances we can demonstrate the better it will be for the customers (example: can upload but not delete et al)
